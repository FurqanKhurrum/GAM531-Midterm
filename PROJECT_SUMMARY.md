## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Setting**: Inside a futuristic space observation pod
- **View**: First-person camera with 360° rotation
- **Environment**: Deep space with rotating planet, orbiting moon, star field
- **Interaction**: Toggle interior lighting system with L key

### Technical Highlights
1. **Advanced Graphics**
   - Full Phong lighting model (ambient/diffuse/specular)
   - Multiple textured objects
   - Proper normal mapping for lighting
   - Depth testing for correct 3D rendering

2. **Smooth Controls**
   - FPS-style WASD movement
   - Mouse look with sensitivity control
   - Vertical movement (Space/Shift)
   - Cursor capture for immersive experience

3. **Animation System**
   - Planet rotates continuously on Y-axis
   - Moon orbits the planet in circular path
   - Dynamic scene with realistic movement

4. **Professional Code Quality**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - IDisposable pattern for resource management
   - Comprehensive XML documentation comments
   - Error checking and logging
   - Modern C# practices

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Review the Code (Optional but Recommended)
Take a few minutes to read through the code to understand:
- How the rendering pipeline works
- How Phong lighting is calculated
- How camera transformations work
- How meshes are created and rendered

### 2. Test Run (If You Have .NET SDK)
```bash
cd SpacePod_Midterm_Game
dotnet run --project Game/Game.csproj
```

### 3. Upload to GitHub
Follow the **GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions:
- Option 1: GitHub Desktop (easiest)
- Option 2: Git command line
- Option 3: Direct upload on GitHub.com

### 4. Submit
1. Get your repository URL from GitHub
2. Submit to your instructor before **October 30 at 11:59pm**
3. If private repo, add instructor as collaborator

## 💡 How to Explain Your Project

When discussing your project with your instructor, you can say:

*"I created a Space Observation Pod game where the player sits inside a spacecraft and observes celestial bodies. The game features a rotating planet with an orbiting moon, all set against a starfield backdrop. The main interaction is toggling the pod's interior lighting system using the L key, which dramatically changes the scene's atmosphere through Phong lighting calculations. I implemented four different meshes using VAO/VBO/EBO, applied three procedurally-generated textures, and created a full first-person camera system with WASD and mouse controls. The code is organized into clean, reusable classes for Shader, Texture, Mesh, and Camera management."*

## 📚 What You Learned

This project demonstrates mastery of:

2. **OpenGL Pipeline**
   - Vertex Array Objects (VAO)
   - Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO)
   - Element Buffer Objects (EBO)
   - Shader compilation and linking
   - Texture binding and sampling

3. **Lighting**
   - Phong reflection model
   - Ambient lighting
   - Diffuse lighting (Lambert's law)
   - Specular highlights
   - Normal transformations

4. **Game Development**
   - Input handling
   - Camera systems
   - Frame-based animation

## 🎨 Customization Ideas (Optional)

If you have time and want to improve further:

1. **Add More Objects**
   - Additional planets or moons
   - Asteroids or space stations
   - More pod interior details

2. **Enhance Lighting**
   - Multiple light sources
   - Colored lights
   - Point lights vs directional lights

3. **Add Effects**
   - Particle systems (stars twinkling)
   - Glow/bloom effects
   - Better textures

4. **Improve Interaction**
   - Door that opens/closes
   - Telescope zoom feature
   - Information displays

## ⚠️ Important Notes
