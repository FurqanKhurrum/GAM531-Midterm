# Space Observation Pod - 3D Game Midterm Project

A fully interactive 3D space observation experience built with C# and OpenTK, where you sit inside a futuristic space pod and observe celestial bodies with dynamic lighting.

## üìù Description

You are positioned inside a space observation pod floating in deep space. Through the pod's viewport, you can observe a beautiful rotating planet with its orbiting moon against a stunning star field backdrop. The pod features an interior lighting system that you can toggle on and off, dramatically changing the atmosphere of your observation experience.

## üéÆ Gameplay Instructions

### Controls

- **W/A/S/D** - Move the camera around inside the pod
- **Mouse Movement** - Look around (360-degree view)
- **Space** - Move camera up
- **Left Shift** - Move camera down
- **L** - Toggle interior pod lighting (main interaction feature)
- **ESC** - Exit the game

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK 8.0 or higher** - [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (optional but recommended) or any C# IDE
- **Windows/Linux/macOS** (OpenTK is cross-platform)

### Dependencies

The project automatically downloads these NuGet packages:
- `OpenTK 4.8.2` - OpenGL bindings for .NET
- `StbImageSharp 2.27.14` - Image loading library

### Building with Visual Studio

1. Open `Game.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Right-click the solution ‚Üí "Restore NuGet Packages"
3. Press **F5** to build and run in Debug mode
4. Or press **Ctrl+F5** to run without debugging

### Graphics Pipeline

1. **Vertex Shader** (`vertex.glsl`)
   - Transforms vertices from model space to clip space
   - Calculates normal vectors for lighting
   - Passes texture coordinates to fragment shader

2. **Fragment Shader** (`fragment.glsl`)
   - Implements full Phong lighting model
   - Supports textured and non-textured rendering
   - Handles light enable/disable state

### Math & Transformations

- Model matrices for object positioning and rotation
- View matrix from FPS camera
- Perspective projection matrix (45¬∞ FOV)
- Normal matrix calculation for proper lighting

### Rendering Techniques

- Depth testing for correct 3D occlusion
- Texture sampling with mipmapping
- Efficient instanced rendering with reusable meshes
- Procedural sphere and cube generation

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- 3D mathematics (vectors, matrices, quaternions)
- OpenGL rendering pipeline (shaders, VAO/VBO/EBO)
- Texture mapping and UV coordinates
- Phong lighting model implementation
- Camera systems and input handling
- Resource management and disposal
- Clean code architecture and organization


### Libraries
- **OpenTK** - OpenGL bindings (MIT License)
- **StbImageSharp** - Image loading (Public Domain)
